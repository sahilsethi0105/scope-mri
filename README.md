## Data Availability
The data used in our study has been released on: https://www.midrc.org/
Due to the conditions of our Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Data Use Agreement, data must be obtained in DICOM format directly from the repository. \ However, we have included our preprocessing code: 
- [`MRI_and_metadata_import.py`](https://github.com/sahilsethi0105/scope-mri/blob/main/src/MRI_and_metadata_import.py): 

## Running training, tuning, and testing
- [`labrum_train.py`](https://github.com/sahilsethi0105/scope-mri/blob/main/src/labrum_train.py): trains models, does cross-validation, and does inference using either MRNet data or SCOPE-MRI
- [`labrum_tune.py`](https://github.com/sahilsethi0105/scope-mri/blob/main/src/labrum_tune.py): tunes models using either MRNet data or SCOPE-MRI
- See the README in the src/ folder for specific commands

## Grad Cam: Interpreting what our models learned
- [`grad_cam_med.py`](https://github.com/sahilsethi0105/scope-mri/blob/grad_cam/grad_cam/grad_cam_med.py): outputs GradCam heat maps of what the model is "looking at" in each image
- See the README in the grad_cam/ folder for specific commands
