# scope-mri
This repository accompanies the release of the SCOPE-MRI datasetâ€”a publicly available shoulder MRI dataset with image-level labels for several different pathologies. The dataset is described in our paper _SCOPE-MRI: Bankart Lesion Detection as a Case Study in Data Curation and Deep Learning for Challenging Diagnoses._ [`Link to Paper`](...)

This is an extension of the work described in our prior paper:

## Data Availability
The data used in our study has been released on the [`Medical Imaging and Data Resource Center (MIDRC)`](https://www.midrc.org/). Non-commercial access is freely available per MIDRC's usage policies to government and academic researchers. You can search for our MRIs in their system and download the DICOMs (~67 GB). Then, follow the data preprocessing steps below.

## Preprocessing
- [`MRI_and_metadata_import.py`](https://github.com/sahilsethi0105/scope-mri/blob/main/src/MRI_and_metadata_import.py):
- [`train_test_val_creation.py`](https://github.com/sahilsethi0105/ortho_ml/blob/main/train_test_val_creation.py): 

## Running training, tuning, and testing
- [`labrum_train.py`](https://github.com/sahilsethi0105/scope-mri/blob/main/src/labrum_train.py): trains models, does cross-validation, and does inference using either MRNet data or SCOPE-MRI
- [`labrum_tune.py`](https://github.com/sahilsethi0105/scope-mri/blob/main/src/labrum_tune.py): tunes models using either MRNet data or SCOPE-MRI
- See the README in the src/ folder for specific commands

## Grad Cam: Interpreting what our models learned
- [`grad_cam_med.py`](https://github.com/sahilsethi0105/scope-mri/blob/grad_cam/grad_cam/grad_cam_med.py): outputs GradCam heat maps of what the model is "looking at" in each image
- See the README in the grad_cam/ folder for specific commands
